# EscapeFromTartarus

An game made with Unity from the course [RPG Core Combat Creator: Learn Intermediate Unity C# Coding](https://www.udemy.com/unityrpg/)

# What I Learned
Everything need to build a 3d RPG with Unity :

* Player Moviments 
* UI (Life bar / Mana Bar / Skill Bar)
* AI (Base UI for Enemys)
* Construction of Terrains
* Combat Systems ( Attacks / Animations / Special Abilities)
* LOTS of time Debugging
* Importance of GitHub ( When you lost your project -.- )
